📚 Library Management Frontend Application
A modern, responsive web application serving as the user interface for a comprehensive library management system. It allows users to browse, add, edit, delete, and borrow books, as well as view a summary of borrowed items.

✨ Features
This frontend application provides the following core functionalities:

Book Management (CRUD UI):

Add New Books: User-friendly form to add new book entries with various details.

View Books:

Homepage (Card View): A visually appealing landing page displaying books as interactive cards, ideal for browsing. Includes a search bar to filter books.

All Books Page (Table View): A dedicated page providing a detailed, tabular list of all books, also with search, offering a comprehensive overview.

Edit Existing Books: Intuitive forms to update book details, including availability based on copies.

Delete Books: Confirmation dialogs for safely removing book entries from the collection.

Borrowing System Interface:

Borrow Books: Users can initiate borrowing directly from book cards or table rows via a modal form.

Quantity & Due Date Input: Collects required information for borrowing.

Real-time Updates: Reflects changes in book availability immediately after a successful borrow.

Borrow Summary Display:

Aggregated View: A dedicated page displaying a clear, aggregated summary of all borrowed books, showing the total quantity borrowed for each distinct book.

Responsive Design: Optimized for seamless experience across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) using Tailwind CSS.

User Notifications: Utilizes Sonner for sleek, dismissible toast notifications for actions like success messages or errors, enhancing user feedback.

Robust Error Handling: Comprehensive error display for API failures, providing clear feedback to the user.

🚀 Technologies Used
This frontend project is built using a modern React ecosystem:

React.js: A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.

TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability.

Vite: A next-generation frontend tooling that provides an extremely fast development server and optimized build process.

Redux Toolkit (RTK Query): For efficient global state management and simplified data fetching, caching, and invalidation from the backend API.

React Router DOM: For declarative routing within the single-page application.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs and responsive layouts.

Shadcn UI: A collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

Sonner: A beautifully designed toast notification library for user feedback.

date-fns: A lightweight and consistent date utility library for parsing, formatting, and manipulating dates.

Lucide React: A comprehensive collection of beautiful, pixel-perfect icons used throughout the application.

🏁 Installation & Setup
Follow these instructions to get the frontend application up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

Your backend API must be running and accessible (either locally or deployed).

Installation Steps
Clone the Frontend Repository:

git clone <your-frontend-repo-url>
cd Library-Management-Frontend # Or your frontend project folder name

Install Dependencies:

npm install
# or yarn install

This will install all the necessary React, Redux, Tailwind, and other libraries.

Create .env File:
Create a file named .env (or .env.local for Vite) in the root of your frontend project and add the following:

VITE_REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:5000/api"

VITE_REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL: This should point to your backend API.

If your backend is running locally, use http://localhost:5000/api.

If your backend is deployed (e.g., on Vercel or Render), use its deployed API URL (e.g., https://your-backend-app.vercel.app/api).

Run the Frontend Application:

npm run dev
# or yarn dev

The frontend application should open in your browser, typically at http://localhost:5173.

💡 Usage
Once the frontend application is running:

Homepage (/): You will land on the HomePage displaying your book collection in a visually appealing card view.

Use the integrated search bar to filter books by title, author, genre, or ISBN.

Each book card provides direct "Edit", "Delete", and "Borrow" buttons.

Add New Book (/add-book): Click the "Add New Book" button (available on the homepage) to navigate to the dedicated form.

Edit Book (/edit-book/:id): Click "Edit" on a book card to open the edit form for that specific book.

Delete Book: Click "Delete" on a book card. A confirmation dialog will appear. Confirm to remove the book; the list will automatically update.

Borrow Book: Click "Borrow" on a book card. A modal form will appear. Enter the desired quantity and due date. The book's available copies will update in real-time, and if copies reach zero, it will be marked "Unavailable."

View All Books (/books): Click "Explore My Library (Table View)" on the homepage to switch to the traditional tabular list of all books.

Borrow Summary (/borrow-summary): Click "View Borrow Summary" to navigate to a page displaying an aggregated list of all borrowed books, showing total quantities.

🚀 Production Deployment
For production, you can deploy your frontend to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, Render, etc. These platforms offer excellent integration with Git repositories and provide global CDNs for fast delivery.

Vercel: Excellent for React apps. Just link your Git repository on Vercel.

Netlify: Another popular choice for static sites and SPAs.
